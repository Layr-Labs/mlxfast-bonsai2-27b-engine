# fetch-goldens.sh -- fetch pin-verified golden objects from the track's R2
# bucket for track bonsai2-27b-mlx-v1.
#
# THE SCRIPT HAS TWO MODES, both organizer-side. A participant never needs it:
# the two public captures for --local-iterate and --local-submit ship in this
# repository under correctness_prompts/bonsai2-27b-mlx-v1/.
#
#   1. ONE OBJECT:
#        tools/fetch-goldens.sh --r2-path KEY --sha256 HEX --bytes N --out FILE
#      It fetches one object and keeps it only when the bytes match the pin.
#      A pin that fixtures/bonsai2_27b_mlx_v1_track.json declares hidden is
#      refused, by key and by digest, so a pin copied out of the contract
#      cannot pull organizer material onto a participant machine.
#
#   2. THE WHOLE PINNED SET, for the organizer staging a ranked box:
#        tools/fetch-goldens.sh --all --out DIR
#      It reads the contract, then fetches every timed_prompt_pool tape and
#      every live_golden_speculative oracle into DIR. DIR is the directory the
#      box's runner service exports as MLXFAST_QWEN38_GOLDEN_DIR. These objects
#      are organizer material, so this mode needs R2 credentials and refuses
#      without them. Run tools/ranked-box-preflight.sh afterwards: it verifies
#      the staged set against the contract again.
#
# WHY THE GOLDENS ARE NOT IN THIS REPOSITORY. The 8 timed-pool tapes and the
# per-depth oracles are organizer material. They are published in R2 at the
# r2_path keys the contract pins, and the ranked box stages them out of band.
# They are never in git. The public captures are different material: they are
# participant goldens for local runs, and they ship in git.
#
# THE R2 CONVENTION THIS MIRRORS (do not re-derive it):
#   * The base URL lives in the environment variable R2_BUCKET_ENDPOINT and
#     NOWHERE ELSE. It is secret-tier: never hardcode an endpoint, a bucket
#     name, or an account host in this repository. Ask the organizer for the
#     R2 base.
#   * The BUCKET IS PART OF THE ENDPOINT, never part of r2_path. Prefixing the
#     bucket onto the object key is the documented way to waste a day; the
#     earlier tracks' runbooks record it costing three ranked dispatches.
#   * Object keys live under correctness_prompts/<track_id>/, which is also the
#     branch name and the track id -- one string, three roles.
#   * Verify BYTE COUNT FIRST, then sha256, and delete the file on either
#     mismatch: a truncated transfer is the common failure and the byte count
#     names it precisely, where a bare hash mismatch does not.

Usage: tools/fetch-goldens.sh --r2-path KEY --sha256 HEX --bytes N --out FILE

Fetch one object from the track's R2 bucket and accept it only if it matches
the supplied {sha256, bytes} pin exactly. The file is removed on any mismatch,
so a failed run never leaves half-verified bytes behind.

  --r2-path KEY   Object key, e.g. correctness_prompts/bonsai2-27b-mlx-v1/NAME.json
                  The BUCKET IS NOT PART OF THIS -- it is in R2_BUCKET_ENDPOINT.
  --sha256 HEX    64 lowercase hex characters. Required: there is no unpinned fetch.
  --bytes N       Exact byte count. Required, and checked before the hash.
  --out FILE      Destination path.
  --allow-hidden  Organizer/box escape hatch; see below. Needs credentials too.

THE R2 BASE URL COMES FROM THE ENVIRONMENT ONLY:

  export R2_BUCKET_ENDPOINT='https://<host>/<bucket>'   # ASK THE ORGANIZER

It is secret-tier material. It is deliberately absent from this repository and
must stay that way -- keep it in your .env, never in a file you commit.

The public captures for --local-iterate and --local-submit ship in this
repository under correctness_prompts/bonsai2-27b-mlx-v1/; nothing here fetches them.

THE HIDDEN GUARD: every pin in fixtures/bonsai2_27b_mlx_v1_track.json (the
timed_prompt_pool tapes, the per-depth oracles and hidden_correctness_golden)
is organizer material. This script refuses to fetch any of them by key OR by
digest, so a copy-pasted pin from the contract cannot quietly pull that
material onto a participant machine. --allow-hidden lifts that refusal for one
object and additionally requires R2 credentials to be present.

Usage: tools/fetch-goldens.sh --all --out DIR

Stage the WHOLE pinned set for a ranked box: every timed_prompt_pool tape and
every live_golden_speculative oracle, each verified against its {sha256, bytes}
pin, into DIR. A file that already matches its pin is left alone, so the mode
is safe to re-run. It finishes by finding the hidden_correctness_golden digest
among the staged files.

  --all           Stage the whole pinned set. Needs R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID and
                  R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY.
  --out DIR       The staging directory. Export it to the runner service as
                  MLXFAST_QWEN38_GOLDEN_DIR, then run
                  tools/ranked-box-preflight.sh.

It matches a timed_prompt_pool[] tape or hidden_correctness_golden in
fixtures/bonsai2_27b_mlx_v1_track.json. Those objects are organizer-side: the GETs
are credentialed, the tapes are a benchd format local --golden modes cannot
load, and the anti-lottery cohort stops being hidden the moment a participant
holds all eight.

If you are the organizer staging a box, use --all --out DIR, which stages the
whole pinned set (credentials are required as well); --allow-hidden lifts this
refusal for one object. If you are looking for a golden to iterate against
locally, use the shipped public captures under
correctness_prompts/bonsai2-27b-mlx-v1/.
